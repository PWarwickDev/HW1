Project Description: This website is designed to be a news page and general hobby site for space exploration. 
I used Visual Studio Code to complete this portion of the project, and updated github directly as I proceeded through the code.

General Structure: I have created 5 HTML files which the website consists of:

    All files contain a logo with my name designated under it at the top, and a navbar consisting of 4 links to navigate the webpage. 
    
    There is also a footer on each page to make it look more stylish, the copyright is there, as well as 3 links you'll generally see on real websites, but these links are stubs.

    Here are the descriptions of the body of each HTML file:

        index.html: Any click on the "home" tab of the navbars in the files directs here.
        This is the main file of the website, of which there consists the website description and "hook" of the page, as well as some buttons under "Latest News" which direct news.html and 
        contact.html. There is also an "Explore More" header which has 3 links to the 3 major space organizations which this website focuses on. 

        news.html: This is reached either by clicking "news" on the navbar of any file, or through the "Read More" button of the index.html file. This file consists of a "News" header which has 3 bulleted sections containing some recent events in space news, with links through the "More Info" text which go to the websites where I got the information on it. 

        org_details.html: Reached through clicking "Organization Details" in a navbar. This file consists of 3 tables, which give info on NASA, ESA, and SpaceX. 

        gallery.html: Reached through clicking "Gallery" in a navbar. Shows 3 photos with descriptions of what they are. 

        contact.html: Reached through clicking "Contact Us" button in index.html. This file is a stub page with links for if this was a real news website. The contact details are made up.
